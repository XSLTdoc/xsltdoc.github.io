  XSLTdoc - A Code Documentation Tool for XSLT
  
    
      XSLTdoc is a Javadoc-like tool for all versions of XSLT (1.0,
      1.1, 2.0). This project has recently been moved, with kind permission from 
      the original authors Iwan Birrer and Alessandro Pasetti, from 
      SourceForge to this new home on 
      GitHub (project repository at XSLTdoc/XSLTdoc). 
    The XSLTdoc tool defines
      conventions to document XSL "code elements" directly in the source code. These
      "documentation elements" are then extracted by the XSLTdoc
      tool to build a documentation consisting of several linked HTML pages
      which provide easy browsing through the documentation. The
      XSLT source code is available with syntax highlighting.
    
    
      XSLTdoc was developed in a project funded by the European Space Agency 
      under contract 18664/04/NL/LvH.
    
    
      XSLTdoc is written in XSLT 2.0 and is documented with XSLTdoc (This 
      page). It is freely available on a GPL licence.

      Please open a GitHub 
        issue if you need help or have comments on XSLTdoc.
    
    This tool has recently been worked on a bit to make it easier to
      install and use. Please see the README file on
      GitHub for some instructions on how you can install and run it very
      easily.
      The instructions below have not been completely updated yet
      to reflect recent changes.

    Installing XSLTdoc
     Installation of XSLTdoc is simply done by unzipping the XSLTdoc
      distribution file in a dedicated target directory (usually called
      XSLTdoc). 

    Running XSLTdoc
    XSLTdoc is written in XSLT 2.0. You need an XSLT 2.0 processor to run it.
      The downloadable package of XSLTdoc includes the free version of the Saxon
      XSLT and XQuery Processor from Saxonica Limited, which needs an installation
      of a java virtual machine to be run.
    
      To generate a documentation for one or more XSLT programs you need to write a 
      configuration file which inlcudes all the information needed for the generation process.
      The configuration file is a simple XML file. Use the template below as a starting 
      point for your own configuration file. Not mandatory elements are marked.
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<XSLTdocConfig>
  <Title>The title used on the main page</Title>
  <Introduction>
    This section is copied to the main documentation page. It can include any HTML tags.
  </Introduction>
  
  <!-- 
    The absolute or relative path to the target directory 
    where the HTML files are created. If a relative path
    is used it is always relative to the config file.
   -->
  <TargetDirectory path="../doc"/>
  <!-- 
    The absolute or relative path to the source directory.
    This is where the XSLT source files can be found.
    If a relative path is used it is always relative 
    to the config file.
   -->
  <SourceDirectory path="./"/>
  <!-- 
    A list of source code files which shall be documented. 
    Only stylesheets which are not included by another
    have to be listed here. The included stylesheets
    are found automatically by following the include or
    the import statements in the including stylesheet.
    Relative references are relative to the SourceDirectory
    defined above.
   -->
  <RootStylesheets>
    <File href="xsltdoc.xsl"/>
    <File href="test.xsl"/>
  </RootStylesheets>
  
  <!-- 
    A list of CSS Stylesheet files which should be added to the standard CSS file included (XSLTdoc.css)
    - Not mandatory
    - media attribute optional.
  -->
  <AdditionalCSS>
    <File href="print.css" media="print"/>
  </AdditionalCSS>
</XSLTdocConfig>
    
    To start the generation process use the configuration file 
    as the input for the xsltdoc.xsl program. 
    The command using Saxon 8 XSLT processor looks like this (while being in the XSLTdoc installation folder):
    java -jar lib/saxon8.jar <configuration file> xsl/xsltdoc.xsl
    Fonts, colors and layout of the HTML documentation are defined in two CSS
      files which can be found in the CSS folder of the installation. Copy both
      files to the folder where the documentation was generated. With ant this
      step can easily be automated. See the build.xml ant-file that is used to
      generate the documentation for XSLTdoc as an example:
    <?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes" ?>
<project name="XSLTdoc" default="xsltdoc" basedir=".">
  <description>Ant Build file for the XSLTdoc program</description>

  <path id="classpath">
    <pathelement location="lib/saxon8.jar" />
    <pathelement path="${java.class.path}" />
  </path>

  <target name="xsltdoc">
    <delete dir="doc" />
    <copy todir="doc">
      <fileset dir="css">
        <filename name="*.css" />
      </fileset>
    </copy>
    <xslt force="true" style="xsl/xsltdoc.xsl" in="xsl/XSLTdocConfig.xml" out="doc/log.txt">
      <!-- The target directory must be given relative to stylesheet  -->
      <classpath refid="classpath" />
    </xslt>
  	<delete dir="doc/log.txt"/>
  </target>
</project>
    
    Documenting the code
    Documentation elements are written in XML. Because XSLT is expressed in
      XML too, it is necessary to define a new namespace for XSLTdoc to enable a
      XSLT processor to distinguish between documentation and source code. The
      URI for this namespace is
      http://www.pnp-software.com/XSLTdoc. This namespace must be
      declared in any stylesheet which uses XSLTdoc for documenting. Example:
    <xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
                xmlns:xd="http://www.pnp-software.com/XSLTdoc" version="2.0">
  ...
<xsl:stylesheet>
	General documenting rules
    The documentation is normally added before the source element that should
      be documented. Generally this looks like this (with the XSLTdoc namespace
      mapped to xd):
    <xd:doc>
  ...
</xd:doc>
<xsl:...>
    Any XSLTdoc documentation is enclosed in a xd:doc element.
      If you just want to write a plain text comment the xd:doc element can contain simple text. 
      Text before the first period is considered as short description, the remaining as detailed description:
    <xd:doc>
  This is the short description. And here comes a more detailed 
  description that appears in the detailed view of the documentation only.
</xd:doc>
<xsl:...>
    If you use this technique no HTML elements are allowed in the text. If you want to use HTML tags
      within short and detailed description the text for the short and detailed description needs to enclosed in
      special XSLTdoc tags:
    <xd:doc>
  <xd:short>This is the short description with <code>HTML tags</code>.</xd:short>
  <xd:detail>
    And here comes a <b>more detailed</b> 
    description showed only in the detailed view of the documentation.
  <xd:detail>
</xd:doc>
<xsl:...>
	Stylesheet documentation
	The documentaion of a stylesheet is the only exception where the documentation 
	is written as a subelement of the target element (xsl:stylesheet). To mark a documentation element
	as a stylesheet documentation the type attribute of the xd:doc element must be set to 'stylesheet'.
	A stylesheet documentation can have the following subelements (properties): xd:author, xd:copyright, xd:cvsId, xd:svnId:
    <xsl:stylesheet ...>
  <xd:doc type="stylesheet">
    ...
    <xd:author>ibirrer</xd:author>
    <xd:copyright>P&amp;P Software, 2007</xd:copyright>
    <xd:cvsId>$Id: XSLTdocConfig.xml 42 2009-01-16 15:02:32Z ibirrer $</xd:cvsId>
  <xd:doc/>
  ...
<xsl:stylesheet>
	Properties can be added by writing a property extension. See the properties directory of the XSLTdoc
	installation for examples.
    Stylesheet Parameter
    
      To document a stylesheet parameter you can use the type attribute of the xd:doc element
      to define its type:
      <xsl:stylesheet ...>
...
  <xd:doc type="string">
    A Stylesheet parameter of type string.
  </xd:doc>
  <xsl:param name="outputDir"/>
  ...
</xsl:stylesheet>
	Function/Template Documentation
    The parameter of a template or a function can be described with a
      xd:param element. The name attribute is obligatory for
      templates and functions while the type attribute is optional for
      template definitions.
    <xd:doc>
  A template with a parameter of the type string.
  <xd:param type="string">The string to be processed.</xd:param>
</xd:doc>
    

    
    Look at the source code of the XSLTdoc tool for more examples. The source
      code is accessible through this website. Just go to a detailed description
      of a template or function and click on the source link.
    
    Inline tags
    You can use so called inline tags to tag special parts inside a xs:short or xd:detail element:
    The xd:xml inline tag can be used to to print print an xml to the output. The whole xml inside the tag is transformed to html by XSLTdoc.
    <xd:doc>
  <xd:detail>
    The following XML inside the xd:xml tag is printed exactly as it shows here:
    <xd:xml>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    Bla
  </body>
</html>
    </xd:xml>
  <xd:detail>
</xd:doc>
<xsl:...>
